# Dentralized Exchanges
"Dex" stands for **Decentralized Exchanges**, which is a place where people can trade (buy or sell) cryptocurrencies directly with each other without using middleman, like a bank or traditional exchange.

### How is works in Blockchain
1. No middleman - There's no central entity managing the trades. You just use a platform (the marketplace) to find people willing to trade with you.

2. Smart Contracts - These are like automated stalls. You walk up to a stall, drop in your goods (cryptocurrency), and the smart contract ensures the trade happens safely and fairly with whoever wants to buy it. 

3. Direct Ownership - On a Dex, you own your cryptocurrency until the moment you decide to trade it. There's no central party holding it for you.

So, a Dex is basically a digital version of a farmer's market for trading cryptocurrencies without involving big intermediaries.

In simple terms, a DEX (Decentralized Exchange) is acryptocurrency trading platform that operateswithout a central authority, allowing users totrade assets directly with one another (peer-to-peer) using smart contracts.

# CEX
"Cex" stands for **Centralized Exchange**, which is an online platform where you can buy, sell, or trade cryptocurrencies, but this platform is run by a company that acts as a middleman to facilitate the trades.

### How it works in Blockchain
1. Middleman - The Cex (exchange) acts like the supermarket. It holds all the cryptocurrencies and manages the buying and selling for you. You deposit your money into their account, and they handle the trades.
2. Order Matching - When you want to buy or sell cryptocurrency, the Cex automatically matches your order with another user’s order, like how a supermarket restocks or sells items to customers.
3. Custody - When you trade through a Cex, you don’t actually hold your cryptocurrency directly. It’s more like putting money in your supermarket’s gift card; the exchange holds your crypto for you until you want to withdraw it.

So, a Cex is like a supermarket for cryptocurrencies where the company (the exchange) controls all the trading, matching, and storage of the assets. Unlike a Dex (the farmer’s market), here you rely on the supermarket (exchange) to handle everything for you.
