# Dentralized Exchanges
"Dex" stands for **Decentralized Exchanges**, which is a place where people can trade (buy or sell) cryptocurrencies directly with each other without using middleman, like a bank or traditional exchange.

### How is works in Blockchain
1. No middleman - There's no central entity managing the trades. You just use a platform (the marketplace) to find people willing to trade with you.

2. Smart Contracts - These are like automated stalls. You walk up to a stall, drop in your goods (cryptocurrency), and the smart contract ensures the trade happens safely and fairly with whoever wants to buy it.
