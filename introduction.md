# Why Blockchain?
## Inflating currencies
Government has been printing currencies left, right and center. This leads to increasing inflation.

Holding onto cash is a loser's bet in the long run. Holding on to any assest(GOLD, STOCK, REAL ESTATE) is better compared to currencies like USD, INR, JPY.

## Fractional Reserve Banking
Banks don't have your money. They lend out most of it.
If there is a bank run (everyone going to the bank to withdraw their money), banks won't be able to pay everyone.

## Bailouts
The 2008 Financial crisis was triggered by a financial instrument called mortgage-backed securities. 
Even though the banks at Wall Street were at fault, the government ended up bailing them out using Taxpayer money.
But why does the government get to decide whom to bailout, whom to not?

### All these developments led to the concept of a new, decentralized currency (not maintained by a central authority)

## How to create a new currency?
Right now, currencies can only be issued by central governments. You canâ€™t just create your own coin and ask users to use it.

Even if you do create your own coin, no one would use it, and for good reasons -
- You can print any number of coins, making yourself richer.
- You become the central mint and verification authority for the coin.
- No one would (or should) trust you.
