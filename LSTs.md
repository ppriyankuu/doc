# What is an LST?
An LST (Liquid Staking Token) is a type of token that represent a user's staked assets in a Proof-of-stake blockchain. When you stake your cryptocurrency, you often cannot access or trade it while its staked. Liquid Staking allows you to maintain liquidity while still participating in the staking process.

1. **Staking** - When you staking your cryptocurrency with a liquid staking provider, you receive an equivalent amount of LSTs in return. These tokens represent your staked assets.
2. **Liquidity** - Since LSTs can be traded or used in other decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, you can take advantage of market opportunities while your original assets remain staked.
3. **Earning Rewards** - While holding LSTs, you still earn staking rewards on the underlying assets, typically reflected in the value of the LST.
