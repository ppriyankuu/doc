# RPC, json-RPC
JSON-RPC is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol encoded in JSON (Javascript Object Notation). It allows for communication between a client and a server over a network. JSON-RPC enables a client to invoke methods on a server and receive responses, similar to traditional RPC but using JSON for data formatting.
