# RPC, JSON-RPC
JSON-RPC is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol encoded in JSON (Javascript Object Notation). It allows for communication between a client and a server over a network. JSON-RPC enables a client to invoke methods on a server and receive responses, similar to traditional RPC but using JSON for data formatting.

AS a user, you interact with the blockchain for two purposes - 
 - To send a `transaction`.
 - To fetch some details from the blockchain (balances, etc).

In both of these, the way to interact with the blockchain is using JSON-RPC.
