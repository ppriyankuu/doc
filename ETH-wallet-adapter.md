# Wallets in ETH
Let's think of an Ethereum wallet like a combination of a physical wallet and a key to your safety deposit box at a bank. Here's how each concept in Ethereum wallets compares to real-life situations -
1. Hot Wallets (Connected to the Internet)
    Imagine you have a wallet app on your phone or computer that you use for quick, small transactions, like paying for coffee or groceries. Just like you’d keep some cash in a regular wallet for daily use, a hot wallet lets you easily access your digital money. But since it's "connected" (like carrying cash with you), it’s a bit riskier to carry large amounts in it because it’s more vulnerable to being "stolen" by hackers.
2. Cold Wallets (Offline, Safer)
    Cold wallets are like a locked safe in your home or a bank vault. They aren’t connected to the internet, so they’re safer from hackers. People use cold wallets to store large amounts of cryptocurrency they don’t plan to use soon. It’s similar to keeping valuable jewelry in a secure place, rather than carrying it around.
3. Wallet Addresses (Like a Bank Account Number)
    Your wallet address is like your bank account number. You share it with others so they can send you money. In Ethereum, this address usually starts with "0x" and lets people send ETH or tokens to your wallet without giving them access to your funds.
4. Seed Phrases (Backup Key)
    A seed phrase is like a master key or a backup to your wallet. Imagine you have a 12- to 24-word code, and if you lose your wallet, this code can restore everything inside. Just like if you had a spare house key hidden somewhere safe, your seed phrase helps you "unlock" your wallet even if your phone or computer is lost. It’s crucial to keep this hidden, like a spare key, because anyone who has it can "open" your wallet and take your funds.
5. Private Keys (The Actual Key to Access Your Funds)
    A private key is like the actual key to your wallet. It’s what allows you to "open" the wallet and access or spend the cryptocurrency inside. Imagine it’s like having a key to your safety deposit box. You don’t give this key to anyone because, with it, they could access everything in your wallet.

## Wallet Adapter
In the blockchain world, a wallet adapter is a tool that allows apps to connect with various types of wallets. Think of it as a bridge between an app (like a game or marketplace) and your crypto wallet (like uniswap).

Different wallets may have different ways of working, but a wallet adapter standardizes the connection. This means you can use your preferred wallet (like MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet) with any app that supports wallet adapters, without needing extra setup. It makes the process smoother and more compatible across different wallets, so you can interact with blockchain apps easily.

### Wagmi Library
Imagine you have a shopping app, and you want to give users the ability to pay with their crypto wallets (like MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet) instead of a credit card. Setting this up could be complex because every wallet works a bit differently, and you’d have to manage things like logging in, staying connected, and processing payments smoothly.

Wagmi is a library that simplifies this for developers who are building blockchain applications. It’s like having a toolkit that handles all the tricky parts of connecting with different wallets, so the developer doesn’t have to write a lot of complicated code. Here’s how it helps:
1. Connecting Wallets Easily - Just like an online store lets you "sign in with Google" or "sign in with Facebook," Wagmi lets developers set up options for users to connect their crypto wallets easily.
2. Automatic Reconnection - Imagine if you get disconnected from a streaming service while watching a show, and it remembers where you left off without you having to do anything. Wagmi does something similar with wallets—it reconnects the wallet automatically if there’s a disconnection.
3. Managing User Information - Wagmi also keeps track of important things like which wallet is connected, the user’s balance, and any changes in the network (like switching from Ethereum to another blockchain). This is like an app that remembers your shopping cart and preferred payment method.

### TanStack, Viem, and Wagmi
- TanStack - A collection of powerful libraries for React, like React Query for data fetching and caching, React Table for tables, and React Router for navigation. It helps manage and display data efficiently in web applications.
- Viem - A TypeScript library designed for blockchain developers to interact with Ethereum and other blockchains. It provides tools to make Ethereum calls, handle wallets, and manage blockchain data, with a focus on speed and accuracy.
- Wagmi - A React Hooks library for building blockchain applications. It simplifies wallet connections, manages user sessions, and handles Ethereum interactions, making it easier for developers to create smooth, user-friendly crypto experiences.
